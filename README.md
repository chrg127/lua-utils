A bunch of lua utility libraries made for fun. Here's the rundown:

- fmt.lua: utilities for formatting and printing stuff. The huge thing here is
  being able to print table structures, even indented, as well a format()
  function that works very similar to python.
- oop.lua: implementation of a simple OOP system for lua.
- util.lua: general utilities, check inside for details.

Unless otherwise noted, all these libraries are on the public domain.
